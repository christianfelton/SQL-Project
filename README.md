<h1>New Wheels Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Business Context:

A lot of people in the world share a common desire: to own a vehicle. A car or an automobile is seen as an object that gives the freedom of mobility. Many are now preferring pre-owned vehicles because they come at an affordable cost, but at the same time, they are also concerned about whether the after-sales service provided by the resale vendors is as good as the care you may get from the actual manufacturers. New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company, has launched an app with an end-to-end service from listing the vehicle on the platform to shipping it to the customer's location. This app also captures the overall after-sales feedback given by the customer. 

Problem Statement:

New-Wheels sales have been dipping steadily in the past year, and due to the critical customer feedback and ratings online, there has been a drop in new customers every quarter, which is concerning to the business. The CEO of the company now wants a quarterly report with all the key metrics sent to him so he can assess the health of the business and make the necessary decisions.

Objective:

As a data scientist, you see that there is an array of questions that are being asked at the leadership level that needs to be answered using data. Import the dump file that contains various tables that are present in the database. Use the data to answer the questions posed and create a quarterly business report for the CEO.
